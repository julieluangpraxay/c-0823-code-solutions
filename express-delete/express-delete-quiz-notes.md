## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the significance of an HTTP request's method?
  The choice of HTTP method is significant because it communicates the intent of the client's request and determines how the server should handle the request. It helps maintain the statelessness and idempotence of the HTTP protocol and ensures that clients and servers can interact with predictability and consistency. Different methods have different implications for caching, security, and the potential for side effects, so selecting the appropriate method for a given task is crucial for the proper functioning of web applications.
