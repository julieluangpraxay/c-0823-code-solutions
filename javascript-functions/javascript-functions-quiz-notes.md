## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  A function in JavaScript is a block of code that performs a specific task or a set of tasks.
- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  function keyword, function name, parameters and the function body
- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  A function call involves using the function's name followed by parentheses to pass arguments and execute the function's code
- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?

A function definition involves declaring the structure and behavior of a function, including the function keyword, a name, parameters, function body with code, and optionally a return statement, while a function call is the act of using the function's name with parentheses and passing arguments to execute the defined code and potentially receive a return value.

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  parameter is a variable listed in the function's definition
  An argument is the actual value that is passed to the function when it is called.
- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  they enable functions to accept specific inputs, making the code reusable, adaptable, and allowing for customization
- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  it immediately terminates the function's execution, and it specifies the value that the function will output (return)
