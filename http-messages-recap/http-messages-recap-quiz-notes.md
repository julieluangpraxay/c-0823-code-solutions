  A web server is computer software and underlying hardware that accepts requests via HTTP (the network protocol created to distribute web content) or its secure variant HTTPS.
- Which HTTP method does a browser issue to a web server when you visit a URL?
  the browser typically issues an HTTP GET request to the web server. The GET method is used to retrieve data from the server, such as web pages, images, documents, or any other resources available at the specified URL. It is the most commonly used HTTP method for fetching web content.
- What is on the first line of an HTTP **request** message?
  GET, PUT, or POST. aka http methods
- What is on the first line of an HTTP **response** message?
  request line, headers and message body
- What are HTTP headers?
  The start-line and HTTP headers of the HTTP message are collectively known as the head of the requests, whereas its payload is known as the body.
- Is a body required for a valid HTTP message?
  a body is optional because for some requests, (like resource retrivals using the GET method), there is nothing to specify in the body of your request.
