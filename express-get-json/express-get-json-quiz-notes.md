## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is an API endpoint?
  An API endpoint is a specific URL that represents a particular function or resource in a web-based API, allowing software to interact with it by making HTTP requests to perform actions or retrieve data from the server. Each endpoint is like a distinct entry point into an API, defining what you can do and access within that system.
- What is the appropriate `Content-Type` header for HTTP messages that contain JSON in their bodies?
  Content-Type: application/json
  This header tells the recipient (usually a web server or client) that the content of the message's body is in JSON format. It helps both the sender and the recipient understand the data format being used, ensuring that the JSON data is properly processed.
