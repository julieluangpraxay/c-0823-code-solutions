## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a database schema?
  A database schema is a logical design or blueprint that defines the structure, organization, and relationships of data in a database. It defines how data is stored, how tables are related to each other, and the constraints and rules that apply to the data. In essence, a schema specifies the overall framework for the database, including the tables, their columns, data types, and relationships between them.
- What is a table?
  A table is a fundamental concept in a relational database. It is a structured collection of data organized into rows and columns. Each column in a table represents a specific attribute or field, and each row contains a single record or data entry. Tables are used to store and manage data in a database.
- What is a row?
  A row, also known as a record or tuple, is a horizontal entity within a table. Each row represents a single data entry or a specific instance of an entity. For example, in a "Customers" table, each row could represent a single customer, with each column containing specific information about that customer, such as their name, address, and contact details.
- What is an attribute and what other names are used to describe them?
  An attribute, also known as a field or column, is a vertical entity within a table. It defines a specific characteristic or property of the data being stored in the table. For example, in a "Products" table, attributes might include "ProductID," "ProductName," "Price," and "Description." These attributes define the type of data that can be stored in each column of the table. Different database management systems (DBMS) and contexts may use various terms like "field," "column," or "attribute" interchangeably to refer to the same concept within a table.
