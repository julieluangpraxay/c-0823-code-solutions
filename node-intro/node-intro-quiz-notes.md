## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What are the 3 components of a fullstack Web architecture?

1. Presentational layer
   The frontend is responsible for the user interface and user experience, built using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it interacts with the backend to provide a user-friendly interface.
2. Application layer
   Application Layer (Backend): The backend manages server-side logic, data processing, and communicates with databases and external services to handle requests, enforce security, and execute business logic.
3. Data storage and management
   This component deals with data persistence and retrieval, using databases and storage systems to store, organize, and manage the application's data.

- What is Node.js?
  Node.jsÂ® is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.
  Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications.

- What can Node.js be used for?

Node.js is primarily used for server-side web development, allowing developers to create scalable and high-performance web applications. It's also suitable for building real-time applications, APIs, streaming services, IoT devices, and a wide range of other applications due to its event-driven, non-blocking architecture.

- What is a REPL?
  A REPL, which stands for "Read-Eval-Print Loop," is an interactive programming environment that allows developers to enter and execute code one line at a time. It reads the code you input, evaluates it, prints the result, and then waits for the next input, creating an iterative and interactive development experience. REPLs are commonly used in interpreted programming languages like Python, JavaScript, and Ruby, where developers can experiment with code, test small code snippets, and get immediate feedback.

- When was Node.js created?

Node.js was created by Ryan Dahl and was initially released in 2009. It has since become a popular and influential JavaScript runtime environment for server-side applications, known for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture and its ability to handle a large number of concurrent connections.

- What backend languages have you heard of?
  JavaScript (Node.js): Node.js allows JavaScript to be used on the server-side, making it a full-stack language.

Python: Known for its simplicity and readability, Python is widely used for web development, data analysis, and various other applications.

Ruby: Ruby on Rails is a popular web framework for building web applications, and Ruby is the programming language behind it.

Java: A versatile language used for building robust, scalable, and enterprise-level applications.

PHP: Often used for web development, PHP is especially popular for creating dynamic web pages and server-side scripting.

C#: Developed by Microsoft, C# is commonly used for building Windows applications, web applications (with ASP.NET), and game development (with Unity).

Go (Golang): Known for its efficiency and performance, Go is used in web development, cloud services, and microservices.

Scala: Often used with the Play Framework, Scala is a language that combines object-oriented and functional programming paradigms for web applications.

Perl: While less popular today, Perl is still used for web development, system administration, and text processing.

Rust: Known for its focus on memory safety and performance, Rust is used for systems programming and backend development.

Elixir: Built on the Erlang Virtual Machine, Elixir is designed for highly concurrent and fault-tolerant systems, making it popular for web applications and real-time systems.

Swift: Developed by Apple, Swift is used for building iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS applications, but it can also be used for server-side development.

Haskell: A functional programming language used for various applications, including web development with frameworks like Yesod.

Kotlin: Kotlin, officially supported for Android app development, can also be used on the server side with frameworks like Ktor.

Lisp: Common Lisp and other Lisp dialects are used for various applications, including web development and artificial intelligence.
